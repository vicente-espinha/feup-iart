Project A2: Research applied to evacuation

### Objective

Determine a plan to evacuate a group of tourists trapped on a mountain.

### Description

It is intended to evacuate tourists who have been trapped on a mountain.Transport vehicles are located at n strategic points / locations. It is also known the place of the shelter to where the tourists should be evacuated. Vehicles have limited capacity and there is only one vehicle at each of the n strategic points considered.

The program should determine the optimal route to evacuate all tourists in the shortest time. The transport vehicle may not have sufficient capacity to carry all the tourists that are in a certain place, reason why: the same vehicle makes more than a trip; or use a second vehicle.

Consider two versions of this work:

* version 1: The tourists to evacuate are in the same place.

* version 2: The tourists to evacuate are in different places.
